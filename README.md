# Crumble 

A menu wordlist generator for pentesting/auditing passwords using different password techniques.
Made this program to specifically complement other password cracking tools such as hashcat and john the ripper.
Another reason I made this is because other programs did not have what I was looking for were, outdated, did not want to memorize commands ,and did not want 
my computing performance to hinder because of VM.


# Features


* Create wordlist from scratch
* Merge two or three wordlists
* Replace characters in a wordlist
