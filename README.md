# Crumble 

A menu wordlist generator for pentesting/auditing passwords using different password techniques.
Made this program to specifically complement other password cracking tools such as hashcat and john the ripper.
Another reason I made this is because other programs did not have what I was looking for, outdated, did not want to memorize commands ,and did not want 
my computing performance to hinder because of VM.


# Features


* Create wordlist from scratch
* Merge two or three wordlists
* Replace characters in a wordlist
* Swap 
* Permute
* Wordlist Analysis
* And more


# Usage
1. Download the files (repo or download zip)
2. Compile the files
3. Run the program
4. Type letters according to menu

**When adding files,you may drag and drop on to the terminal or if you have any issues with drag and drop, you may type in the name of the file ending with ".txt" just make sure that the program is in the same folder or directory. Your output files will also appear where the program is located.**
