**WINDOWS ONLY**

**SUMMARY:**
SUMMARY:

Program using while-loop that will run through a wordlist from a given file and that will delete words or really long words, based on its character length that the user sets it to.

One good scenario of when to implement this tool is when you know or have an idea of how long a password is, so when you download (or create) wordlists, you are able to delete short words that are useless to you and take up storage in your USB or computer.
