# Crumble 

A menu driven wordlist generator for pentesting/auditing passwords using different password techniques.
Made this program to specifically complement other password cracking tools such as hashcat and john the ripper.
Another reason I made this is because other programs did not have what I was looking for were, outdated and did not want to memorize commands.
In other words I wanted to make specific changes while trying to keep it simple, as as person who likes to crack hashes, I figured something like this would really benefit me and others who like to crack hashes.
